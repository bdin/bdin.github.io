            <p>When Kusanya Cafe opened its doors to the public in 2013, founder Phil Sipka had doubts about opening up the space in Englewood.</p>
            
            <p>The neighborhood, located in the South Side of Chicago, has one of the highest homicide rates in the city and is not where one would expect to find a nonprofit cafe.</p>

            <p>“Englewood has been a really vulnerable and abused community for a few decades now,” Sipka said. “I’m pretty proud of us for being able to stick it out in the heart of Englewood.”</p>
            
            <p>Nonprofit cafes are a rising trend nationwide, as the appeal of selling products for a good cause is hard to pass up, said Kate Thoene, social enterprise director of the Southwest Autism Research & Resource Center. Instead of soliciting corporate gifts and donations, which is how most nonprofits are run, these cafes generate their own revenues to help fund the causes they support.</p>

            <p>However, operating a nonprofit cafe is challenging. Thoene, who has worked with nonprofits for over a decade and ran multiple nonprofit cafes, said factors critical to success are location and identity. Cafes must open where there is demand, and they must operate as any for-profit cafe would.</p>

            <p><strong>Looking for home</strong></p>

            <p>Nonprofit cafes such as Kusanya Cafe and Inspiration Kitchens, located in Uptown, are located in rougher areas of the city, but not all nonprofit cafes find themselves in these circumstances. In June 2012, a Panera Cares community cafe opened in Chicago. Operating as a nonprofit branch of Panera Bread with a pay-what-you-can model, the cafe shuttered in early 2015.</p>
            
            <p>The branch was located on West Diversey Parkway, the border between Lincoln Park and Lakeview, areas with median household incomes upward of $75,000, according to the most recent 2014 American Community Survey from the U.S. Census. In comparison, the 2014 federal poverty level threshold for a household of five was $27,910.</p>
            
            <p>Marianne Graziadei, vice president of Panera Cares, said the Chicago location was closed because it had reached the end of its lease and the building required extensive repairs. The investment in “a building that was beyond reasonable maintenance” was not justifiable, she said.</p>
            
            <p>In October 2014, Jamie Bennett, 43, visited the Chicago location after learning about the Panera Cares business model. The New York resident said the cafe piqued his interest because of its commitment to economic integration and community development, while operating at a corporate-franchise standard.</p>

            <p>“The Panera Cares model only works if you have an economically diverse neighborhood, because you need as many people paying more than the cost of food items as you do the people who need to pay less,” said Bennett, who has worked closely with nonprofits.</p>
            
            <p>Lincoln Park, home to three-Michelin-starred restaurant Alinea and various high-end retailers, and Lakeview, which surrounds Wrigley Field, are not such neighborhoods, which may have contributed to the Chicago cafe closing.</p>
            
            <p>What Bennett said, however, is certainly true for the branch in the St. Louis area, which is in walking distance from a jail, a courthouse and a Ruth’s Chris Steak House, and the location in Boston, situated in the city’s government center.</p>
            
            <p>“There are people here from all walks of life, that are either working in the area, coming down here for government things or coming for court or a million different things,” said Bob Zykan, the manager of the Boston location. “We are in the very center of an economically, socially diverse area.”</p>
            
            <p><strong>Growing pains</strong></p>

            <p>Kusanya Cafe, which operates on a traditional business model, has also faced challenges from being in its location in Englewood, where its main competitor is Burger King, as opposed to Starbucks. Sipka said it is often challenging to compete against stores that offer lower prices.</p>
            
            <div style="width: 100%"><img id="cafe" src="kusanya.jpg"></div>

            <p>A big hurdle the cafe faces is simply convincing people that it is worthwhile to come out and spend time at the cafe. Most view coffee as a commodity good, rather than a luxury good, making it harder for people to justify spending the extra money, he said.</p>
            
            <p>“We are doing something that hasn’t been done in decades and bringing revenue in is very tough for us,” Sipka said. “It is a lot more difficult than running a normal cafe.”</p>
            
            <p>Despite the difficulties, the cafe has benefited from being in Englewood. It has allowed the cafe to build a strong sense of community within the neighborhood and with its client base. The goal of the cafe as a nonprofit was to unite Englewood together — which Sipka said is diverse socially, economically and educationally — and he said he believes the cafe has done that.</p>
            
            <p>Even if a nonprofit cafe has found a successful location, Thoene said it still has to consider its identity and make sure it is as much of a business as it is a nonprofit. Those that neglect to do so are in jeopardy of failure, she said.</p>
            
            <p>“The ones that close down are probably businesses that are focused on running like a nonprofit and don’t operate like a business first,” she said. “You need business experts and acumen to survive.”</p>
            
            <p><strong>Finding Inspiration</strong></p>

            <p>At Inspiration Kitchens, several patrons said they never would have known the cafe was a nonprofit, as the service operates like any for-profit cafe. Some even said they found the service better at Inspiration Kitchens than at other cafes.</p>
            
            <p>The only thing that might give it away? The “Dine Well, Do Good” sign hanging in the kitchen entrance.</p>
            
            <p>“If you didn’t know walking in that it was a nonprofit, then you wouldn’t know when you walked out,” said TJ Olson, 39, who has been coming to the cafe for more than a decade. “It was a nice thing to do the first time because it was a good cause, but we come back just like any other restaurant because it’s good.”</p>
                        
            <p>Evan Cauble-Johnson, chief development officer of Inspiration Corporation, which runs the cafe, said this is intentional.</p>
            
            <div style="width: 100%"><img id="cafe" src="inspirationkitchens.jpg"></div>

            <p>The cafe, which doubles as a job-training program for the homeless, aims to challenge social stigmas around homelessness. Since the cafe opened in 2005, he said it has helped customers realize that everyone is capable of giving back to the community.</p>
            
            <p>“For a lot of people that come from disadvantaged backgrounds that we work with, once they get their foot in the door, if they just keep working hard and have the skill sets, they can work their way up,” he said.</p>

            <p>Inspiration Kitchens also operates a space in Garfield Park, a location Cauble-Johnson said the corporation chose because of its proximity to areas with high poverty rates and people coming out of prison programs. Both locations were opened with job training rather than making money in mind.</p>
            
            <p>Although he said the goal of the cafe is not to turn a profit but to help those in need, Cauble-Johnson said if he had to do things differently, he would plan more strategically. Instead of having a restaurant in Garfield Park, he said it would be more beneficial to open a training space in one area and have a separate restaurant in a nicer area.</p>
            
            <p>Ultimately, nonprofit cafes must run as a business, but that doesn’t necessarily mean having the bottom line in black is the end game for these spaces.</p>
            
            <p>“Some never do make revenue and some don't have a goal of generating a net profit,” Thoene said. “Some just have the goal of serving the community through job creation or internships or even exposure and those things have value that might come first. The profit second. The mission comes first.”</p>
