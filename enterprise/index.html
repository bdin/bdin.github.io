                            <p id="paragraph">shouts Maryjoy Heineman, as she moves a block of wood and a clamp to make room for herself at the construction table in her classroom.</p>
                            <p id="paragraph4">Heineman, a mathematics teacher at Evanston Township High School, leads the <a style="color: #ffffff" href="http://dailynorthwestern.com/2014/10/19/city/eths-construction-class-hopes-to-build-on-last-years-results/" target="_blank">Geometry in Construction</a> class, one of the more than 100 mixed-level courses offered at ETHS. These courses are the high school’s attempt to bridge the achievement gap between white students and traditionally underrepresented black and African-American students and Hispanic and Latino students.</p>
                            <p id="paragraph4">At ETHS, mixed-level courses put regular- and honors-level students together in the same classroom, giving students the option to earn regular or honors credit. Although these courses have had a long history at ETHS, the school decided to fully implement its <a style="color: #ffffff" href="http://www.eths.k12.il.us/assets/1/Documents/2013-14%20Restructured%20Freshman%20Year%20Evaluation_Year%201%20report.pdf" target="_blank">Restructured Freshman Year Initiative</a> in the 2012-2013 school year by requiring mixed-level English and history courses for freshmen who score above the 40th percentile in reading and mixed-level biology for all freshmen.</p>
                            <p id="paragraph4">This move was a response to the noticeably overwhelming number of white students and the striking lack of students of color in honors courses, said ETHS Principal Marcus Campbell.</p>
                            <p id="paragraph4">“Although we’re very diverse, the school has seen it as being problematic when you look at an honors-level course and it’s all white,” Campbell said. “And you look at a regular-level course, and it’s all majority students of color.”</p>

												<p id="paragraph3">The lack of diversity is indicative of the achievement gap, which is not just an ETHS issue. A College Board <a href="http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/rtn/10th-annual/10th-annual-ap-report-to-the-nation-single-page.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> found the proportion of self-identifying white students who take an Advanced Placement test is significantly higher than the proportion of self-identifying black and African-American students and Hispanic and Latino students who take an AP test combined. The same holds true for the proportion of students who receive a passing score of three or better on these exams.</p>
												<p id="paragraph3">According to ETHS’s <a href="http://www.eths.k12.il.us/assets/1/Documents/Opening%20School%20Report_FINAL%202.pdf" target="_blank">2014-2015 Opening School Report</a>, the proportion of self-identified black and African-American students and Hispanic and Latino students enrolled at ETHS is 45.8 percent of the student body, slightly higher than the proportion of self-identified white students enrolled at 44.7 percent.</p>
												<p id="paragraph3">Campbell hopes having students of mixed abilities share the same classroom will encourage more students of color to pursue honors-level coursework.</p>
												<p id="paragraph3">“This is a way for us to encourage high expectations for all kids,” he said. “Not just for white kids, but all kids. That’s why we’re doing this.”</p>
												<p id="paragraph3">What distinguishes honors-level students from regular-level students is determined by the teacher, Campbell said.</p>
												<p id="paragraph3">“In my head, I’m teaching the kids at an honor level,” Heineman said. “When I assess them, I have different expectations. When they have a test, all the problems are available to all of the students, but if you’re a regular-level student, I only grade you out of seven out of the nine or something like that.”</p>
												<p id="paragraph3">This approach allows Heineman to start a conversation with regular-level students about moving into honors-level if they feel they are able to tackle all of the problems, as opposed to only the ones being graded.</p>
												<p id="paragraph3">“In preparing for this course, I knew going into it I had to teach it at an honors level and expect a lot from everybody, regardless of what level they have chosen,” she said. “I think it becomes a richer course for all of the kids.”</p>

                                <p id="paragraph4">The mixed-levels educational model is not a new concept; however, its implementation is still debated by education researchers.</p>
                                <p id="paragraph4">Robert Slavin, the director of Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Research and Reform in Education, reviewed experimental evidence on grouping students by ability and published his findings in 1987.</p>
                                <p id="paragraph4">Slavin found that grouping had almost no effect on academic performance among lower, middle and higher aptitude students. A major concern was students were being differentiated by level, but the curricula remained the same for all students.</p>
                                <p id="paragraph4">“There’s no evidence that (higher-level students) are harmed in terms of their achievement,” he said. “A high-achieving kid is going to be a high-achieving kid.”</p>

                                <br>
                                <p id="paragraph4">According to Slavin’s research, grouping had no measurable benefits in terms of learning. However, potential problems arise, including the achievement gap. Slavin cited the concern of “having bias enter in, where kids who are either African-American or Hispanic or maybe from the wrong side of the tracks are felt to not be up to the standards of this class.” Consequentially, these students don’t get into more advanced classes and feel like they don’t belong in them.</p>
                                <p id="paragraph4">“What (ETHS) is apparently doing is very sensible, by saying you don’t need to be in a separate class in order to have higher expectations,” he said.</p>
