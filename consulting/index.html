<div id="headline">Want essay help? You've found it!</div>

<div class="storytext">
	<p>Hi! My name is Ben, and I'm an experienced writer and editor. I graduated from Northwestern University in 2018 with a degree in journalism. I've worked as a journalist covering a wide-range of topics from cities across the world, including the Olympics, Hollywood and a presidential election. What got me into journalism was my love for writing. And today, that's what I want to share with you. Whether you're looking for help editing a college admissions essay or feedback on something else you wrote, I'm here for you.</p>

	<p>I know you're probably thinking, "Why should I trust some random guy on the internet?" That's a great question! I have a track record of success, working with outlets like The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg News and NBC.</p>

	<p>My emphasis (a.k.a. what I'm passionate about but not my sole area of expertise) is on helping high-school students with their college admissions essays. Like many of you, I had no idea what I was doing and I would have loved to have some extra help. Starting in high school and throughout college, I edited essays for my friends, family and other acquaintances. <span class="highlight">I helped them brainstorm ideas, put their thoughts down onto paper (more like Google Docs these days) and polish their work into something they were proud of.</span></p>

	<p>My biggest fault is probably that I care too much and I'm a perfectionist. If you work with me, I'll push you to really bring forth who you are into your essay. But what can I say, maybe that's not such a bad thing? <span style="font-family: Arial">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</span></p>

	<p>You're probably wondering this, and I'll be honest with you: The essays I've edited have helped people get into colleges, MBA programs and law schools at universities such as Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Chicago, Georgetown University, New York University, the University of Southern California, UC Berkeley, UCLA and, of course, Northwestern, as well as liberal arts colleges such as Bowdoin College and Amherst College. (I'm currently working with some medical school applicants, so fingers crossed for them!)</p>

	<p>If that's something you're interested in, feel free to reach out to me at <a class="link" href="mailto:benjamin.din@gmail.com" target="_blank">benjamin.din@gmail.com</a>. We can figure out where you're at, what your needs are and a reasonable rate. Hope to hear from you soon!</p>
